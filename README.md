# 🧠 Adaptive Logic-of-Thought (A-LoT)

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of **Adaptive Logic-of-Thought (A‑LoT)**, a dynamic prompting framework designed to enhance large language model reasoning by adapting logical augmentation to task complexity.

## 🔍 Overview

**A‑LoT** intelligently classifies reasoning tasks based on their complexity—**Low**, **Medium**, or **High**—and applies the optimal level of logical prompting accordingly:

- **Low** → Chain-of-Thought (CoT) only  
- **Medium** → CoT + targeted logical hints  
- **High** → Full Logic-of-Thought (LoT) augmentation

This adaptive strategy boosts accuracy on harder problems and reduces overengineering on easier ones.

| Complexity | Total Qs | CoT (✓/Total)   | LoT (✓/Total)   | A‑LoT (✓/Total)    |
|------------|----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Low        | 30       | 27 / 30 (90%)    | 28 / 30 (92%)    | **27 / 30 (90%)**   |
| Medium     | 40       | 28 / 40 (70%)    | 30 / 40 (75%)    | **31 / 40 (78%)**   |
| High       | 30       | 18 / 30 (60%)    | 23 / 30 (78%)    | **23 / 30 (78%)**   |
| **Overall**| 100      | 73 / 100 (77%)   | 81 / 100 (82%)   | **84 / 100 (84%)**  |


🟢 A‑LoT delivers **the highest overall accuracy** while minimizing unnecessary computation for simpler tasks.
